# knowledge-base

A ever expanding collection of notes, random facts, and strategies that I have
learned over time. Notes are organized roughly following the
[Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) system.

## How I take notes

Almost all my notes start by being written down in a notebook using the
[QEC Method](/permanent-notes/QEC-Method-of-Note-Taking). They are then
transcribed to this knowledge-base, linked to other notes, and improved over
time.
