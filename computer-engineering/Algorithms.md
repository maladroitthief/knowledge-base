# Algorithms

Algorithms are step by step procedures that are used for solving a computational
problem. An algorithm is different from a program in that algorithms are used
during the Software-design-phase. An algorithm should be independent of
programming languages and are analyzed for performance. In order to design an
algorithm, a designer must have domain knowledge of the problem that they are
attempting to solve.
