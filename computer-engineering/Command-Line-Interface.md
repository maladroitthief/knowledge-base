# Command Line Interface

A terminal used for interacting with an operating system. CLI applications can
be very useful for a variety of reasons:

- Interact with head-less servers
- String multiple commands together using STDIN and STDOUT
- Can be automated using scripting or schedulers
- Easy to write
