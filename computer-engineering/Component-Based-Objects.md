# Component Based Objects

Thinking using components instead of inheritance can prevent needlessly linking
ideas that are unrelated to one another. Objects built this was can be then
processed by component type, rather than object instance, making it easier to
profile. Using components typically can make extending functionality easier
since they often don't need to modify existing components, they either extend it
or provide alternatives.
