# File

In Linux, everything is considered a file. General files can be anything from
text, audio, pictures, etc. These can be in text or binary format. Additionally
there are [Directory](/computer-engineering/Directory) files that serve as
containers for other files. Finally device files are any IO devices connected to
the computer such as disks, keyboards, etc.
