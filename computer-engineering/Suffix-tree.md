# Suffix tree

An implementation of a [Trie](/computer-engineering/Trie) but instead of holding
characters on the edges, we instead hold sub-strings of the inserted string
going from right to left.

## Construction

A naive approach to construction a suffix tree has a complexity of
[O(m^2)](/computer-engineering/Quadratic-functions) where m is the length of the
input string. This can be improved to
[O(m)](/computer-engineering/Linear-functions) using Ukkonenâ€™s Suffix Tree
Construction Algorithm.
