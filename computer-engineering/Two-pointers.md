# Two pointers

The two pointers technique is a generalization of the
[Sliding-window](/computer-engineering/Sliding-window) technique. The primary
difference is that the two pointers can cross over one another and could
reference different arrays.

## Common use cases

- Palindromic sub-strings
- Sorting colors
- Merging sorted arrays
