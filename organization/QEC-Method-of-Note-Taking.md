# QEC Method of Note Taking

QEC note taking is a method described by Cal Newport in the book "How to Become
a Straight-A Student." QEC stands for **question**, **evidence**, and
**conclusion**. This allows for broad subjects to be broken up into smaller
components and refined to help understand the more critical details. In
addition, this can lead to a better understanding of the big picture that the
idea is trying to convey.
