# Algorithms

Algorithms are step by step procedures that are used for solving a computational problem. An algorithm is different from a [[Programs]] in that algorithms are used during the [[Software-design-phase]]. An algorithm should be independent of programming languages and are analyzed for performance. In order to design an algorithm, a designer must have domain knowledge of the problem that they are attempting to solve.
