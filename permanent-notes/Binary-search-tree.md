# Binary-search-tree

A binary-search tree (BST) is a [Binary-tree](Binary-tree.md) that gives all the elements in order when it is traversed in order. In-order traversal being:

> Left -> Root -> Right

BSTs are useful because of their time complexity.

| Operation | Big-O |
|-----------|-------|
| Access | O(log(n)) |
| Search | O(log(n)) |
| Insert | O(log(n)) |
| Remove | O(log(n)) |

The space complexity of traversing balanced trees is O(h) where h is the height of the tree.
