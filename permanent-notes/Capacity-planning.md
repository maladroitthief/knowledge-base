# Capacity-planning

Capacity planning is ensuring there is sufficient capacity and redundancy to serve projected future demand. It is critical to take steps ensuring that required capacity is in place by the time it is needed.

- **Organic growth:** Gaining new users and adoption
- **Inorganic growth:** Adding new features or marketing campaigns

## Mandatory steps

- Create an accurate organic demand forecast. This should account for the lead time to acquire capacity. Factor in inorganic demand sources into the forecast.
- Perform load testing of both the systems and services
