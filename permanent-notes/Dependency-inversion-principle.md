# Dependency inversion principle

Dependency inversion principle (DIP) is the concept that classes should declare their dependencies through interfaces or APIs. This encourages creating software that is loosely coupled and easier to test/mock. It also implies that high level modules should not depend on lower level models. [[Clean-code]] is largely built in the concept of DIP.
