# Emergency response

Reliability is a function of Mean Time To Failure (MTTF) and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR).

- **MTTF:** How quickly a system can be brought out of health
- **MTTR:** How quickly a system can be brought back to health

Involving humans in emergency response will always add latency to the MTTR.
