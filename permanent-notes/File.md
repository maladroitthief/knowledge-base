# File

In Linux, everything is considered a file. General files can be anything from text, audio, pictures, etc. These can be in text or binary format. Additionally there are [Directory](Directory.md) files that serve as containers for other files. Finally device files are any IO devices connected to the computer such as disks, keyboards, etc.
