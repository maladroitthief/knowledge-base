# Hash table

A hash table is a data structure that can map keys to values using a hash function. It does this by computing an index using the hash function and stores the value in an array.

| Operation | Big-O |
| --------- | ----- |
| Access    | N/A   |
| Search    | O(1)  |
| Insert    | O(1)  |
| Remove    | O(1)  |

To be clear, the $O(1)$ is average case as it depends on the underlying hash function, but in most instances it is safe to assume average case.
