# Logical-operators

Logical operators can be used as conditional logic for connecting commands together

| Operator | Outcome |
| -------- | ------- |
| `&&` | Will run the next command if the first one succeeded |
| `||` | Will run the next command if the first one failed |
| `;` | Will run both commands regardless of the outcome |
