# Logical-operators

Logical operators can be used as conditional logic for connecting commands together

| Operator | Outcome                                              |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| &&       | Will run the next command if the first one succeeded |
| \|\|     | Will run the next command if the first one failed    |
| ;        | Will run both commands regardless of the outcome     |
