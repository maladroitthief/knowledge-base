# Monitoring

Monitoring is the primary method to keep track of a systems health and availability. Monitoring ideally should be interpreted by software systems, not by humans.

## Alerts

Alerts should only be generated when there is immediate action required.

## Tickets

Tickets should only be generated when there is action required, but not urgently

## Logging

Logging should be generated when there is no action required, but there needs to be a record for diagnostic purposes
