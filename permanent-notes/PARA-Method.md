# PARA Method

PARA method is a organizing technique for digital files that claims to be easy
to maintain, simple, and flexible.

PARA has four categories at the top level to encompass all subjects or ideas.

**Project:** Short term projects or tasks that are currently being worked on

**Area:** Long-term responsibilities that need to be worked on or maintained

**Resource:** Ideas that you may want to reference in the future

**Archive:** Anything that is no longer relevant from the other three categories

The order of these folders is intentional depending on how actionable the ideas
should be. In theory you are mean to spend more time in Projects and Areas than
you would Resources and Archives.
