# Queue

A linear data structure that is modified by adding elements to one end and removing them from the other.

| Operation | Big-O |
| --------- | ----- |
| Enqueue   | O(1)  |
| Dequeue   | O(1)  |
| Front     | O(1)  |
| Back      | O(1)  |
| isEmpty   | O(1)  |

## Examples

### go

For short lived queues, the following approach can be taken. Since the memory for the slice is never returned, memory leaks may occur in long living queues.

```go
var queue []string
// Enqueue
queue = append(queue, "Hello")
// Dequeue
queue = queue[1:]
// Front
fmt.Print(queue[0])
// Back
fmt.Print(queue[len(queue)-1])
```

For long lived queues, a linked list is more appropriate. The `container/list` package provides a doubly linked list.

```go
queue := list.New()
// Enqueue
queue.PushBack("Hello")
// Dequeue
queue.Remove(queue.Front())
// Front
queue.Front()
// Back
queue.Back()
```
