# Shell-expansion

Shell expansions are shortcuts that can save a significant amount of time typing.

## File globbing

Replacing a pattern in a file name or directory

| Expansion            | Description                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| ~                    | Expansion for current home directory        |
| \*                   | Matches `0 TO n` characters                 |
| [ab]                 | Matches the characters `a OR b`             |
| [0-9]                | Matches characters in the sequence `0 TO 9` |
| [a-z]                | Matches characters in the sequence `a TO z` |
| ^                    | Negate the expansion: `^[ab]` is NOT a OR b |
| $                    | Match the end: `a$` is ends in `a`          |
| (PATTERN1\|PATTERN2) | Match `PATTERN1 OR PATTERN2`                |
