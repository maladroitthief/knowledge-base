# Shell-variables

Shell variables are variables that are only applied to the current shell instance.

```bash
var=TestVar
echo $var
echo ${var} # long format for expressions in strings
```

## Environment variables

Environment variables are shell variables that are inherited by all system processes. A shell variable can be promoted to an environment variable by exporting it.

```bash
export var=TestVar
```

All current environment variables can be viewed using `export`
