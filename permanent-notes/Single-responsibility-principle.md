# Single-responsibility principle

Single-responsibility principle (SRP) is the concept that a class should only have one job. The intent behind this principle is to not only be more direct with how classes are constructed, but also to avoid creating "junk drawer" classes. SRP also encourages to break one large unfocused class down into smaller precise classes that, in theory, should be easier to test and debug.
