# Sorting and searching

Sorting is the act of rearranging a sequence in some known order such as numerical or lexicographical that is either ascending or descending. Sorting arrays are valuable as they enable binary searching which is faster than [linear time](Linear-functions.md).

## Complexity

### Sorting

| Algorithm      | Time        | Space     |
| -------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| Bubble sort    | O(n^2)      | O(1)      |
| Insertion sort | O(n^2)      | O(1)      |
| Selection sort | O(n^2)      | O(1)      |
| Quicksort      | O(n log(n)) | O(log(n)) |
| Mergesort      | O(n log(n)) | O(n)      |
| Heapsort       | O(n log(n)) | O(1)      |
| Counting sort  | O(n + k)    | O(k)      |
| Radix sort     | O(nk)       | O(n + k)  |

### Searching

| Algorithm     | Time      |
| ------------- | --------- |
| Binary search | O(log(n)) |

## Edge cases

- Empty sequence
- Sequence with one element
- Sequence with two elements
- Sequence with duplicate elements
