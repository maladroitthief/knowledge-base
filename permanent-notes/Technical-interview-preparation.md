# Technical interview preparation

Technical interviews are used for determining a potential software engineer's competence, typically by using questions focused on algorithms and data structures. These interviews can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours depending on the format.

Interviewers usually evaluate candidates with the following criteria:

- **Communication:** Asking clarifying questions, communicating approach and trade-offs
- **Problem solving:** Understanding the question and approaching it systematically, logically, and accurately. Determining time/space complexity
- **Technical competency:** Translating solutions to code with ease
- **Testing:** Testing code with edge cases

## Technique

Before preparing and practice, it is important to develop technique to ensure that you are being efficient in your approach.

## Preparation

Preparing for a technical interview realistically should take 2 to 3 months to fully be prepared, spending 2-3 hours a day studying. The following subjects should be studied while preparing:

- [Array](Array.md)
- [String](String.md)
- [Sorting-and-searching](Sorting-and-searching.md)
- [Matrix](Matrix.md)
- [Tree](Tree.md)
- [Graph](Graph.md)
- [Hash-table](Hash-table.md)
- [Recursion](Recursion.md)
- [Linked-list](Linked-list.md)
- [Queue](Queue.md)
- [Stack](Stack.md)
- [Heap](Heap.md)
- [Trie](Trie.md)
- [Interval](Interval.md)
- [Dynamic-programming](Dynamic-programming.md)
- [Binary](Binary.md)
