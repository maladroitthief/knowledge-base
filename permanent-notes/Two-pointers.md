# Two pointers

The two pointers technique is a generalization of the [Sliding-window](Sliding-window.md) technique. The primary difference is that the two pointers can cross over one another and could reference different arrays.

## Common use cases

- Palindromic sub-strings
- Sorting colors
- Merging sorted arrays
