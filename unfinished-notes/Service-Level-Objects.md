# Service Level Objects

A service level object (SLO) specifies a target level of reliability for a service. The following must be true for an SLO:

- All stakeholders approve that the SLO is appropriate for the product
- The people responsible for ensuring the product meets the SLO have agreed that it is possible under normal conditions
- The organization has agreed to use error budgeting for decision making and prioritization
- There is a process in place for refining the SLO

It is important to realize that 100% reliability is a bad target. Instead the reliability target should be comprised of [[unfinished-notes/Service-Level-Indicators]]
